### 📂 AI-Powered Training & Onboarding System

### Overview
This project summarizes a set of internal tools and resources I designed to improve training and strategic planning using AI, web technologies, and lightweight automation.

## 🎥 Recruitie in Action
Here's a short demo of the internal AI assistant I built to help recruiters generate and structure recruitment plans directly in our CRM environment.

## 🧭 Multi-Campus HTML Portal with Dynamic Tabs (Slate CRM Integration)

To support strategic planning across multiple campuses and programs, I built a modular, HTML-based portal embedded directly in our Slate CRM environment.

This portal serves as the **final delivery hub** for:
- Finalized recruitment plans
- Live admissions and event conversion dashboards
- Embedded CRM reports segmented by campus and program
- Interactive guidance via the Recruitie AI assistant

### 🧩 Portal Architecture Highlights:
- 🔄 **Tabbed Navigation** with JavaScript-controlled dynamic content loading
- 🏫 Campus-specific tabs: PCOM, PCOM Georgia, PCOM South Georgia
- 📊 Embedded Dashboards: admissions metrics, event counts, yield rates
- 🧠 Integrated AI: “Chat with Recruitie” for real-time strategy support
- 🛠️ Hosted securely inside Slate with full role-based access

This system replaced disconnected files and static planning templates with a **central, smart, user-friendly workspace** for recruiters and decision-makers.
