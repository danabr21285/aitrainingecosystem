### 📂 AI-Powered Training & Onboarding System

### Overview
This project summarizes a set of internal tools and resources I designed to improve training and strategic planning using AI, web technologies, and lightweight automation.

## 🧭 Multi-Campus HTML Portal with Dynamic Tabs (CRM Integration)

To support strategic planning across multiple campuses and programs, I built a modular, HTML-based portal embedded directly in a CRM environment.

This portal serves as the **final delivery hub** for:
- Finalized recruitment plans
- Live admissions and event conversion dashboards
- Embedded CRM reports segmented by campus and program
- Interactive guidance via the Recruitie AI assistant

### 🧩 Portal Architecture Highlights:
- 🔄 **Tabbed Navigation** with JavaScript-controlled dynamic content loading
- 🏫 Campus-specific tabs: Campus1, Campus2, Campus3, Dashboards 
- 📊 Embedded Dashboards: admissions metrics, event counts, yield rates, Tableau 
- 🧠 Integrated AI: “Chat with Recruitie” for real-time strategy support
- 🛠️ Hosted securely inside CRM with full role-based access

This system replaced Gsites with a **central, smart, user-friendly workspace** for recruiters and decision-makers.
