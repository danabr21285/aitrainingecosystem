### 📂 AI-Powered Training & Onboarding System

### Overview
This project summarizes a set of internal tools and resources I designed to improve training and strategic planning using AI, web technologies, and lightweight automation.

## 🧭 Multi-Location HTML Portal with Dynamic Tabs (CRM Integration)

To support strategic planning across multiple locations, I built a modular, HTML-based portal embedded directly in a CRM environment.

This portal serves as the **final delivery hub** for:
- Finalized strategic plans
- Live stats and event conversion dashboards
- Embedded CRM reports segmented by location and segment markets
- Interactive guidance via an AI assistant

### 🧩 Portal Architecture Highlights:
- 🔄 **Tabbed Navigation** with JavaScript-controlled dynamic content loading
- 🛠️ Location-specific tabs: Campus1, Campus2, Campus3, Dashboards 
- 📊 Embedded Dashboards: metrics, event counts, yield rates, Tableau 
- 🧠 Integrated AI: “Chat with Planning Assistant” for real-time strategy support
- 🛠️ Hosted securely inside a CRM with full role-based access

This system replaced Gsites with a **central, smart, user-friendly workspace** for staff and decision-makers.
