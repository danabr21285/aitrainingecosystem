### 📂 AI-Powered Training & Onboarding System for Distributed Teams

### Overview
This project demonstrates how AI, web technologies, and lightweight automation can be combined to streamline **training, onboarding, and strategic planning** for large projects involving **teams across multiple locations**.  
The goal: create a **centralized, smart, user-friendly workspace** that’s accessible, engaging, and effective for team members with **different learning styles**.

---

## 🌐 Multi-Location Training & Resource Portal

I designed a modular, HTML-based portal as the **primary delivery hub** for:
- Strategic plans and operational playbooks
- Live dashboards and performance metrics
- Location-specific resources and updates
- AI-powered interactive guidance

The portal supports **asynchronous collaboration**, ensuring everyone—regardless of location, role, or preferred learning format—can access the same up-to-date materials.

### 🧩 Portal Architecture Highlights
- 🔄 **Tabbed Navigation** with JavaScript-controlled dynamic content loading  
- 🗂 **Location-specific sections** for tailored materials (e.g., Region A, Region B, Region C, Company-wide Dashboards)  
- 📊 **Embedded visual dashboards** for KPIs, timelines, and resource tracking  
- 🧠 **Integrated AI Assistant** for real-time Q&A, decision support, and workflow guidance  
- 🌍 **Cloud-hosted and role-based access** for security and version control

This system replaced scattered tools and manual sharing with a **centralized, scalable, and consistent experience** for all users.
